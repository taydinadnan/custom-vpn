# Use specific networks for split tunneling

# Configuration Notes:
# - Replace all PLACEHOLDER values with actual configuration
# - Keep PrivateKey secure and never share it
# - AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0 routes all traffic through VPN
# - For split tunneling, specify only required networks in AllowedIPs
# - PersistentKeepalive helps maintain connection through NAT/firewall
# - DNS setting prevents DNS leaks when using the VPN
