## Network Flow

```
Client Device → Load Balancer → WireGuard Servers → Internet
                     ↓
              Management API ← → Monitoring Stack
                     ↓
              Database & Redis ← → Audit Logging
```

## Security Model

• **Zero-Trust Architecture**: All connections validated
• **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security layers
• **Privacy by Design**: Minimal data collection (7-day retention)

## Security Audit Checklist (Key Points)

✓ **Infrastructure Security**
- MFA enabled, encrypted storage, restrictive security groups
- Network segmentation, VPC flow logs, GuardDuty enabled

✓ **Application Security**  
- HTTPS enforced, API authentication, input validation
- Rate limiting, CORS configuration, secrets management

✓ **System Hardening**
- SSH hardened, fail2ban active, UFW configured
- Automated updates, service minimization, file permissions

✓ **Privacy Compliance (GDPR)**
- Data minimization, 7-day retention, encryption at rest/transit
- User consent mechanisms, breach procedures documented

✓ **Monitoring & Incident Response**
- Centralized logging, security alerting, incident procedures
- Regular audits, penetration testing, documentation updates

## Cost Optimization

### Estimated Monthly Cost (EU-West-1)
- **EC2 Instances**: $45-75/month (2x t3.medium VPN + 1x t3.small mgmt)
- **Load Balancers**: $38/month (NLB + ALB)
- **Storage**: $10-15/month (EBS volumes)
- **Data Transfer**: Variable based on usage
- **Total Estimated**: $93-128/month (excluding data transfer)

### Cost Reduction Options
- Use spot instances for non-production (50% savings)
- Reserved instances for predictable workloads (30% savings)
- Right-size instances based on utilization metrics
